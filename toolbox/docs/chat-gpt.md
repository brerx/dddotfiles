## Let ChatGPT improve your prompts

    I want you to become my prompt creator. Your goal is to help me create the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the process below:
    1. first, ask me what I want the prompt to be about. I will give you my answer, but we need to improve it through constant repetition by going through the next steps.
    Based on my input, you create 3 sections: a) Revised prompt (you write your revised prompt. It should be clear, concise and easy for you to understand), b) Suggestions (you suggest what details you should include in the prompt to improve it) and c) Questions (you ask relevant questions about what additional information I need to improve the prompt).
    2. the prompt you provide should take the form of a request from me to be executed by ChatGPT.
    3. we will continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information and you updating the prompt in the "Revised prompt" section until it is complete.
